# Practice writing for loops using range

# print the numbers from 4 to 14
for i in range(4,15):
  print(i)
# print the numbers from -10 to 10
for i in range(-10,11):
  print(i)
# print the numbers from 1 to 20, counting by 2s
for i in range(1,20,2):
  print(i)
# print the numbers from 1000 to 500, counting backwards by 100s
for i in range(1000,500,-100):
  print(i)
